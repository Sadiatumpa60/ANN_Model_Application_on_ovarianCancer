# Artificial Neural Network Model Implementation on Ovarian Cancer Dataset

In this project we will done binary classification between cancer and non cancer. So for classsifying we will use Artifical Neural Network Model(ANN) and try to find the maximum level of accuracy.

## About Dataset:
It is a open source dataset  where 235 patientâ€™s sample were recorded with signif-
icant number of features with their risk factors.These samples were collected based on full blood(40%)
and serum type(60%). About forty-seven unique measures were collected which we have used as
features in our machine learning model. Mean platelet volume, Basophil Cell Count, Carbohydrate
antigen 72-4, Aspartate aminotransferase, Carcinoembryonic antigen, Carbohydrate antigen 19-9,
and Mean corpuscular hemoglobin are some of them from those unique measures. Beckman Coulter
AU5800 and Sysmex XE-2100 were used as instrumental support.Some significant methods like FCM
with semiconductor laser,Phosphomolyase method,ion selective electrode method,XB-I method were
used to extract those selective measures.

## Result and Methodology:

We have used 16 layers of ANN model including dropout. We have have implemented 20 epochs there. And finally we have got accuracy of 75% on average.
